This is an attempt at writing a tutorial with a couple goals:
1. Help existing LSL scripters on Second Life transition into SLua (Luau).
2. Cover all of the common aspects of SLua that scripters could reasonably be expected to write in their own scripts.
3. Cover some common gotchas and confusions, like _typecasting_ and the difference between `.` and `:`.
4. To discourage certain patterns and footguns, when such patterns are easy to fall into, with a strong solution.

Revisions here can be fairly "dirty." A section should be published onto the [Second Life Wiki](https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/SLua_Alpha) only after it has reached a "stable" state.
